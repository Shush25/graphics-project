The enemies are designed to freely patrol the area and eliminate any player with different powers and weapons or follow the player who enters the area. For this concept of enemy attacking animation the concept and technique of morphing has been used in the game, which allows the animation to be more real like feel and vibe while coming in contact with the enemies.
